we said</strong>: &quot;This project is a great example of the high standard that can be reached with a dedicated space for a home gym. This gym has it all!&quot;<br><br><em><strong>What our customer said</strong>: </em><em>&quot;Mark
did an exceptional job on the design and installation of our new home gym. At
the initial stage he provided expert advice and guidance on what kit was needed
and what brands were most suitable. Not only did he provide fantastic designs
and visuals to show us exactly what the gym would look like but he used his
trade contacts to negotiate a discount on all the equipment bought. He was
there every step of the way to see everything was installed 100% perfectly and
even organised a session for all my kids to explain how to use the equipment
safely. I am over the moon with my new gym and can not recommend Mark and the
