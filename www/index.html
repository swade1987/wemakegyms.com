did an exceptional job on the design and installation of our new home gym. At
the initial stage he provided expert advice and guidance on what kit was needed

and visuals to show us exactly what the gym would look like but he used his
trade contacts to negotiate a discount on all the equipment bought. He was
there every step of the way to see everything was installed 100% perfectly and
even organised a session for all my kids to explain how to use the equipment
safely. I am over the moon with my new gym and can not recommend Mark and the

            <em><strong>What our customer said</strong>: &quot;The guys at
WeMakeGyms were very friendly and business like in their approach. It was
pretty staggering how quickly the gym came together once we had finalised what
we wanted and we are so happy with our new home gym! Mark got us the best
price, saved us all of the hassle and was there every step of the way to ensure
the outcome we wanted! Now my husband has more time in the morning because he
works out at home. I now have follow up Personal Training with one of their
associated PTs once a week and I&#x27;m loving it! We have our 2 young kids come in
and join the fun on the weekends and they love it too! WeMakeGyms has done a
fantastic job - thanks so much Mark and the guys!&quot;<br></em>– <strong>Andrea, Burlington Lane, Chiswick</strong><span data-new-link="true"><strong></strong></span></p>
